pg_lo_import -- 将文件导入为大型对象

  int pg_lo_import([resource connection, string pathname [, mixed object_id]])~

|pg_lo_import| creates a new large object in the database using a file on the
filesystem as its data source.

要使用大型对象（lo）接口，需要将其放置在事务块中。

When safe mode is enabled, PHP checks whether the files or directories being
operated upon have the same UID (owner) as the script that is being executed.

本函数以前的名字为 |pg_loimport|。

{connection} PostgreSQL database connection resource. When {connection} is not
present, the default connection is used. The default connection is the last
connection made by |pg_connect| or |pg_pconnect|.

{pathname} 变量指明了要导入为大型对象的文件名。

{object_id} If an {object_id} is given the function will try to create a large
object with this id, else a free object id is assigned by the server. The
parameter was added in PHP 5.3 and relies on functionality that first appeared
in PostgreSQL 8.1.

导入成功则返回新建的大型对象的 OID，如果出错则返回
FALSE。

Version Description 5.3.0 The optional {object_id} was added.

4.2.0 在 PHP 4.2.0
版本之前，本函数语法不一样，见如下定义：

<?php >
     $database = pg_connect("dbname=jacarta");
     pg_query($database, "begin");
     $oid = pg_lo_import($database, '/tmp/lob.dat');
     pg_query($database, "commit");
?>
